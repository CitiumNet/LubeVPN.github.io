__Decentralized network has multiple nodes__. When two users (i.e. message sender "Alice" & intended recipient "Bob"), who have performed [out-of-band key verification](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/key-verification) from the outset, are trying to start communicating on Citium. The service node of Alice is responsible for hosting the signed source file of the message. All user and service nodes are potentially part of the **message digests delivery network** (MDDN) responsible for hosting the message digests which will provide sufficient information for Bob to locate the source file of the message. No [single point of failure (SPOF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure) can impact the spread of message digests and collection of them through **indiscriminate mesh-tree multicast** (IMTM).

__完全去中心化__：大多數現代在線應用程序服務提供商在使用某種形式的中心化方法（例如，託管于數據中心的服務器）來構建其用戶管理系統。這意味著監視。因為無論服務提供者斷言他們如何有效地保護用戶信息（例如電子郵件，IP，用戶名和密碼）免受惡意管理或駭客攻擊，從理論上講，他們都擁有修改或刪除信息的權力。因此，去中心化是絕對必要的，因為這樣才可以排除任何不幸事故發生，即使只是理論上可能會發生的事故。

__Fully Decentralization__: The majority of the contemporary online application service providers are using some forms of centralized methods (e.g. servers hosted in a datacenter) to structure their user management systems. It means monitoring. Because no matter how vigorously the service providers assert that they are effectively guarding the user information (e.g. email, IPs, username & password) against maladministration or hack, theoretically, they hold the power to modify or delete the information. Therefore, decentralization is absolutely necessary to achieve the level of confidence that one can rule out even theoretical mishaps from happening.
