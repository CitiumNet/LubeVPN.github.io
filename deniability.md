一般來說，加密簽名的消息是同時提供了不可否認性；也就是說，發送者在收到消息後不能否認發送了消息。西蒂姆（Citium）使用的是公鑰驗證器，它保證了可推諉性。任何收件人都可以偽造一個看起來就像聲稱的發件人所產生的信息，所以收件人不能讓第三方相信該信息確實是由發件人產生而不是由收件人偽造的。但是，收件人仍然可以防止第三方偽造。原因是，要進行這種偽造，需要收件人的私鑰。由於收件人自己會知道他是否使用了自己的私密金鑰來進行偽造，所以他可以肯定沒有第三者偽造訊息。

In general, cryptographically signed messages provide non-repudiation; i.e. the sender cannot deny having sent the message after it has been received. Citium uses public-key authenticators instead, which guarantee deniability. Any recipient can forge a message that will look just like it was actually generated by the purported sender, so the recipient cannot convince a third party that the message was really generated by the sender and not forged by the recipient. However, the recipient is still protected against forgeries by third parties. The reason is that in order to perform such a forgery, the private key of the recipient is needed. Since the recipient himself will know whether or not he has used his own private key for such a forgery, he can be sure that no third party could have forged the message.

**不可否認性** 是一個在信息安全中廣泛使用的法律概念。它指的是任何訊息服務系統中，接訊者有充分的理由相信該訊息是由已知的發件人創建的（驗證性），並且該消息在傳輸過程中未發生更改（完整性）。換句話說，不可否認性使得系統用戶很難成功地抵賴消息的信息來自何者/何處、以及消息的真實性。留意，西蒂姆（Citium）不服務此需求。

**Non-repudiation** is a legal concept that is widely used in information security. It refers to any service, which gives a recipient a very strong reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication) and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity). In other words, non-repudiation makes it very difficult to successfully deny who/where a message came from as well as the authenticity of that message. Note, Citium is not built for this.

### 實用價值<br>Practicality

從現實操作來說，很多人都希望獲得可推諉性的溝通辦法，尤其是那些雖然溝通內容合情合理但卻未必能倖免於被法庭傳召或被司法機構強迫作證的溝通內容，例如新聞記者與吹哨人之間的溝通內容，或高壓政權中的社運分子與律師之間的溝通內容。 西蒂姆（Citium）允許否認溝通過的信息曾存在過于任何的存儲介質，和允許模棱兩可化溝通過的信息。

當溝通雙方希望在一個帶有可推諉性訊息安全功能的系統上對話，發件人需要能夠[合理地推諉](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%90%88%E7%90%86%E6%8E%A8%E8%AF%BF)他發送過的訊息，稱之為「發件人可推諉的方案」；預期收件人需要能夠[合理地推諉](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%90%88%E7%90%86%E6%8E%A8%E8%AF%BF)他是被指定的預期收件人，稱之為「收件人可推諉的方案」。

In practice, deniable communication has been sought by users whose legitimate activities may not always be protected from subpoenas or legal coercion, e.g., journalists and whistleblowers, or lawyers and activists in repressive regimes. Citium allows for denying the existence of messages on any storage medium, and for equivocating those messages.

When two parties want to communicate on a system with deniability as one of the main infosec features, the sender of a message want to [plausibly deny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability) that he or she has sent that message, i.e.,  sender-deniable scheme; the intended recipient of a message wants to [plausibly deny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability) that he or she has received that message, i.e.,  receiver-deniable scheme.

### 將脅迫防範於未然<br>Preempt Coercion

西蒂姆（Citium）可否認性的設計原則不是要「說服」脅迫者溝通雙方繳出來的通話記錄都是真實的。 因為眾所周知通話記錄很容易被偽造。相反，我們的目標是 **將脅迫防範於未然**，讓脅逼者理解到在西蒂姆（Citium）上的通信記錄是枉費心機的。只要溝通雙方堅持按原定的措辭去說明溝通的辦法在西蒂姆（Citium）進行，讓脅逼者理解西蒂姆（Citium）的系統原理後，則不可能被脅逼者找到真實的溝通信息。

The purpose of deniability is not at all to "convince" the coercer that any surrendered transcript is real; indeed, it is common knowledge that transcript can easily be faked. Instead, the goal is to **preempt coercion** in the first place by making it useless. Parties who "stick to their stories" explaining to the coercer how Citium works can never be pinned down to the real message.

西蒂姆（Citium）中的「可推諉性」是通過三個訊息安全機制實現的：<br>
Deniability in Citium is achieved through three InfoSec mechanisms:

1. **無需准入許可**<br>**Permissionless**
2. **可推諉驗證**<br>**Deniable Authentication**
3. **分身馬甲帳號**<br>**Sockpuppetry**
