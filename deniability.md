某些中心化通信系統被稱為 *不可否認的*，因為其用戶的目標是系統化地讓其溝通方承擔法律責任。西蒂姆（Citium）不是為這種目標而設計的，而是提供了完全相反的信息安全功能：**可推諉性**。「可推諉性」是針對[**強制披露**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law)和其後患的最後一道防線。不公開的、私下的電子通訊一直是個人和企業通訊中的關注點。發件人（或預期收件人）需要能夠[合理地推諉](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%90%88%E7%90%86%E6%8E%A8%E8%AF%BF)他發送過的訊息（或，是被指定的預期收件人）。西蒂姆（Citium）中的「可推諉性」是通過三個訊息安全機制實現的：

1. **無需准入許可**
2. **可推諉驗證**
3. **分身馬甲帳號**

Some centralized communication systems are said to be *non-repudiable* because their users purposely want to systematically hold their communicating parties legally accountable. Citium does not cater for that purpose. In fact, Citium offers the complete opposite: **deniability**, which is the last line of defense against [**forced disclosure**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law) and its repercussions. Off-the-record electronic communication has always been a concern in personal and business communications. The sender (or the intended recipient) of a message want to [plausibly deny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability) that he or she has sent that message (or being targeted as the intended recipient). Deniability in Citium is achieved through three InfoSec mechanisms:

1. **Permissionless**
2. **Deniable Authentication**
3. **Sockpuppetry**

**不可否認性** 是一個在信息安全中廣泛使用的法律概念。它指的是任何訊息服務系統中，接訊者有充分的理由相信該訊息是由已知的發件人創建的（驗證性），並且該消息在傳輸過程中未發生更改（完整性）。換句話說，不可否認性使得系統用戶很難成功地抵賴消息的信息來自何者/何處、以及消息的真實性。留意，西蒂姆（Citium）不服務此需求。

**Non-repudiation** is a legal concept that is widely used in information security. It refers to any service, which gives a recipient very strong reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication) and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity). In other words, non-repudiation makes it very difficult to successfully deny who/where a message came from as well as the authenticity of that message. Note, Citium is not built for this.
